# âœ… TODO application using raw HTML 

A todo application made using raw HTML via manipulating the Document Object Model. I built this project for learning purposes. This project helped me understand the following things better:
- `HTML`
- `Document Object Model (DOM)`

and the premitives offered by DOM to make responsive websites like:
- `document.createElement`
- `document.appendChild`
- `element.setAttribute`
- `element.children`
